#IMPORTANT: To track Bedrock joins, please make sure that "forward-hostname" is "true" in your GeyserMC config
#When you run the "/easystats platform view <platform>" it will show you both the Java and Bedrock player joins that came from that platform
#You can also append a filter to show you how many joins occurred in a certain timeframe with "/easystats platform view <platform> -t 1h" for the last hour for example

#"/easystats platform view tiktok" will show
#Stats for tiktok:
#Total: 15,000 (Java: 10,000 & Bedrock: 5,000)
#Java: 10,000 (66.67%)
#Bedrock: 5,000 (33.33%)

#"/easystats platform compare main tiktok" will show
#Comparison between main and tiktok:
#Total: 65,000 (main: 50,000 & tiktok: 15,000)
#Java: 50,000 (main: 40,000 & tiktok: 10,000)
#Bedrock: 15,000 (main: 10,000 & tiktok: 5,000)
#main is outperforming tiktok in total joins by 233.3%, Java joins by 300.0%, but is lacking in Bedrock joins by 100.0%

# Platform hostname groupings
# This file defines how different hostnames are grouped into platforms
# Each platform can have multiple hostname patterns
# Patterns can use wildcards (*) to match multiple hostnames

platforms:
  # Example groupings:
  # - name: "Example Platform"
  #   patterns:
  #     - "example.com"
  #     - "*.example.com"
  #     - "sub.example.com"
  
  # Add your platform groupings here
  # Each platform should have a name and a list of hostname patterns
  'main':
  - 'play.server.com'
  'tiktok':
  - 'tiktok.server.com'
